# SVM-SVD
This is the readme for my Master's Thesis repo where I used data science to predict wine character. Much of this is a massive dump, but some of the code is working and I've included the first couple of matrices so you have access to the original content. I used Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition. A copy of the thesis is located in this repo.
